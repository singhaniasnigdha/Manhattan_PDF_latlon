### Data
Three datasets are used for this project, which are obtained from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us). [Open Data for All](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/reports/2015/NYC-Open-Data-Plan-2015.pdf) is an initiative by [Mayor's Office of Data Analytics (MODA)](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/analytics/index.page) and [Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT)](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doitt/index.page) in collaboration with a third party vendor, Socrata, who host make this data available through APIs.

Following are some details about the datasets used:
 * __NYPD Complaint Data Historic__ - Includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) from 2006 upto July 2021.
 * __Legally-Operating Businesses__ - Comprises of businesses/individuals holding a DCA license so that they may legally operate in New York City. Note: Sightseeing guides and temporary street fair vendors are not included in this data set. (Due to COVID-19 pandemic, DCA extended certain license expiration dates and renewal application deadlines which are not reflected in this data set.)
