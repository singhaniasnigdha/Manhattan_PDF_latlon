# Manhattan KDE values using Geographical Coordinates



## Data
Three datasets are used for this project, which are obtained from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us). [Open Data for All](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/reports/2015/NYC-Open-Data-Plan-2015.pdf) is an initiative by [Mayor's Office of Data Analytics (MODA)](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/analytics/index.page) and [Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT)](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doitt/index.page) in collaboration with a third party vendor, Socrata, who host make this data available through APIs.

Following are some details about the datasets used:
 * __NYPD Complaint Data Historic__ - Includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) from 2006 upto July 2021.
 * __Legally-Operating Businesses__ - Comprises of businesses/individuals holding a DCA license so that they may legally operate in New York City. Note: Sightseeing guides and temporary street fair vendors are not included in this data set. (Due to COVID-19 pandemic, DCA extended certain license expiration dates and renewal application deadlines which are not reflected in this data set.)
 * __Public and Private Facilities__ - An aggregation of public and private facilities and program siles that are owned, operated, funded, licensed or certified by a City, State, or Federal agency in the City of New York. It captures facilities that generally help to shape quality of life in the cityâ€™s neighborhoods, including schools, day cares, parks, libraries, public safety services, youth programs, community centers, health clinics, workforce development programs, transitional housing, and solid waste and transportation infrastructure sites.

### Installation
This project was created using Python3.8.

Get the source code on your machine 
```
git clone https://github.com/singhaniasnigdha/Manhattan_PDF_latlon.git
```

Install python dependencies 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Execution
 `scripts/` contains 3 python files, one for each dataset described above. They can be run using
 ```
 python scripts/street_crime_density.py --LIMIT=150000 --PLOT=False --FILE=crime_kde
 python scripts/legal_biz_density.py --LIMIT=500000 --PLOT=False --FILE=legal_biz_kde
 python scripts/facilities_density.py --LIMIT=500000 --PLOT=False
 ```
 
 More information regarding the arguments can be obtained using:
 ```
  python scripts/{script_name}.py --help
 ```
 
 Created KDE models will be saved in a folder called  `kde/` and the generated plots in `images/`.

### Using Existing Models
`models/` contains pre-built KDE kernels for each of the datasets defined above. They can be downloaded, and used to obtain the density estimation for a given latitude and longitude in Manhattan. An example of obtaining the result from a pandas data using the geographical coordinates is shown below. 

```
import cloudpickle

def get_density_est(pd_dataframe):
   # Read the model file
   model_file='2016_crime.cp.pkl'
   with open(model_file, 'rb') as f:
       kernel_fn = cloudpickle.load(f)
   
   # Calculate the density estimation at the given coordinate
   # First argument is latitude, Second is longitude
   kde_fn.pdf(pd_dataframe[['latitude', 'longitude']].to_numpy().T)
```
